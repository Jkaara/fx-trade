## Value iteration
Discount factor (long-terms success 0.9, immediate success 0)

V = R + yV'

greedy policy

## Policy iteration

V = R + y*Sum(weighted Vì)
Converges faster

## TD learning

V = V + alpha*(R + yV' - V)

## Q learning

## RL in trading strategies

Reward function:
- Absolute reward maximization (less used)
- Optimal sharpe ratio (most efficient reward goal for DRL reward algorithms)

Efficiency and performance of trading strategy:
- good match for rapidly-changing environments
- financial markets are dynamic environments
- short-lived and hard-to-identify, unique, patterns
- historical data quickly become irrelevant for predecting current movements

- pattern based strategies are now useless

Successfull = Flexible, able to adpat to current situation

DRL learn on the go and by doing, better at taking real time decisions. Markets are a high density environment for modeling because of all the variables, affecting the outcome of a trading decision. This makes it difficult for the developer to anticipate future market environments which means that they must update their trading algorithms on a more or less continuous basis. An RL algo avoids this by being able to update itself in real time.

Financial market = High density environment

Existing ML algos have 2 main components:
- Strategy: usually designed by the trader
- Implementation: handled by the machine

Get unbiased data from financial market

Human effort:
- requires millions of iteration to be profitable
- reward design is tricky


## Deal with time-series data

To create a supervised dataset from time series, go over the data with a sliding window to get data within the windows as X and future data within a certain horizon as labels.


## Deep LSTM with Reinforcement Learning Layer for Financial Trend Prediction in FX High Frequency Trading Systems

However, often trading systems are interested not only in identifying the current trend but rather in identifying those ‘latent signals’ generated by the market and that in fact constitute the first notices of a trend change. Usually, a change of trend in any financial market is preceded by a so-called transitional period of indefinite duration but in any case short to which a trend reversal will follow


Ex. Do sample cross-correlation funcitons between time series

To the above we add the observation that the foreign exchange market presents strongly non- linear and non-stationary cross dynamics influenced by macroeconomic factors, national and international monetary policies, military conflicts, etc.


high frequency trading (HFT) algorithm that allows fast and rapid financial transactions to be performed with the undoubted advantage of containing losses in the case of incorrect trades although this is counterbalanced by the consequent finding that even profit can only be contained.
