#optimal capital allocation
#portfolio theory
"""
This is the means by which capital is allocated to a set 
of different strategies and to the trades within those 
strategies. It is a complex area and relies on some 
non-trivial mathematics. The industry standard by which 
optimal capital allocation and leverage of the strategies 
are related is called the Kelly criterion.
